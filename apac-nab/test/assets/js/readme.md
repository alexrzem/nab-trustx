# Unit Tests for JS
## Setting up JEST JS (one time activity)
If you are running JS unit tests, for the first time do the following
- Install npm (Follow this https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Run npm install (Picks up dependencies for JEST from package.json in this folder and installs it to node_modules)

## How to write a Jest JS Unit Test case ?

- Create a test JS file in test/assets/js folder with extension as  '.test.js'
Examples : to create a Unit Test for validation.js, create a file named validation.test.js in the above folder
- Write Test cases in the new test js file you had created. (Sample is in /test/assets/js/validation.test.js)
- cd to '/test/assets/js' and Run 'npm test'
